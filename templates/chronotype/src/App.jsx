                        Your chronotype is not a static destiny. It is a biological tendency that interacts with your environment (epigenetics) and evolves as you age (ontogeny).

</div>
<p className="text-sm text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                            Chronotypes shift predictably with age. Children are typically morning-oriented (Lions/Bears). During adolescence, a biological delay occurs, pushing teenagers into the "Wolf" phase (peak lateness occurs at age 19.5 for women and 21 for men). As we enter adulthood, we drift back towards morningness. In elderly years, the circadian clock advances and fragments, often resembling the Lion or Dolphin patterns.

</div>
<p className="text-sm text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                            Pure chronotypes are rare archetypes. Most humans exist on a spectrum. You may be a "Bear with Lion tendencies" (waking early but needing 8 hours sleep) or a "Wolf-Bear" (hating mornings but functional by 10 AM). Stress often pushes Lions toward Dolphin patterns (anxiety-induced waking), while vacations may reveal a latent Wolf tendency in Bears when the alarm clock is removed.

</div>
<p className="text-sm text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                            Genetics account for roughly 50% of your chronotype; the rest is determined by "Zeitgebers" (time-givers). The strongest Zeitgebers are . Humans are remarkably adaptive. By manipulating these variables (e.g., viewing bright light immediately upon waking), you can shift your circadian phase by 1-3 hours, effectively "training" your body to operate in a different zone.

    </p>
<p className="">
        Developed by <strong className="">:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong>, 
        Trezor was one of the first hardware wallets introduced to the crypto market. Since its launch,

<h2 className="">What Is Trezor Wallet?</h2>
<p className="">
        Trezor Wallet is a physical device that securely stores your cryptocurrency private keys offline. 
        Unlike hot wallets connected to the internet, Trezor devices operate in a secure environment, 
        significantly reducing the risk of cyberattacks. Transactions are signed inside the device, 
        ensuring that your private keys never leave the hardware wallet.
    </p>
<p className="">
        Trezor currently offers popular models such as the 
        <strong className="">Trezor Model One</strong> and 
        <strong className="">Trezor Model T</strong>. 
        Both models provide high-level security, but the Model T includes a touchscreen interface 
        and supports a broader range of cryptocurrencies.

<h2 className="">Why Choose a Hardware Wallet?</h2>

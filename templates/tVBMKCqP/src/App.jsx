<h1 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Building Aura vs DreamCut</h1>
<div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
<p>So Aura took 3 weeks, inc the Mac app and the site.</p>
<p>This is insane because DreamCut took me 3 months. It was my first time making a Mac app and my first time working with <span className="text-blue-400">@supabase</span>.</p>
<p className="font-medium text-white">Thoughts about the full dev below.</p>
<p>First of all, AI is getting scary good. BUT I still do a lot of micro adjustments to the design. AI deeply needs curation, taste and tons of iterations. You cannot go in expecting things to work on first try.</p>
<p>This is as it SHOULD be. Without iterations, all products will look the same. For example, while I didn't spend days on the logo, I still did many iterations on it.</p>
<p>It usually starts with mockups on gpt-4o or figma + plugins. Like the awesome Pointillism plugin. The site design started with <span className="text-blue-400">@lovable_dev</span>. These are the first prompts. Looks nothing like the final results.</p>
<p>I don't use Figma to build landing pages anymore. AI is too unpredictable. Even if I had a design or concept in mind, there is zero guarantee that it'll get fully realized with AI.</p>
<p>AI is like a saw or a hammer. It's great when it works, but when it's not precise and you need to sand things manually.</p>
<p>After the first 20 prompts or so, I moved on <span className="text-blue-400">@cursor_ai</span>. You NEED granularity. You need to get into the details and for each section, each component, you NEED tens of iterations/prompts.</p>
<p>Lovable isn't built for that kind of precision, at least for now. Was great for setting up the site though, like Vite, React, TailwindCSS.</p>
<p>That's why you have to go to each file, prompt the heck out of it. Give it context, like styles, ui kits, images, references, figma urls, etc. Study the heck of Tailwind colors, spacing rules, design system. Learn the tech terms.</p>
<p>For example, it took me 5 prompts to get the cursor dots thing going starting with "Can you make it so that the cursor when moving, there are dots appearing surrounding it. similar to this."</p>
<p>Speaking of a references and code components, http://21st.dev was also nice to get some components. I got the little cpu chip animation from there and customized it.</p>
<p>I also designed a lot of animated components from Aura's Mac app, like the animated visualizers, which was originally made in SwiftUI for the Keyboard Shortcuts screen.</p>
<p>Languages won't matter anymore, at least when it comes to components and visual stuff. So Mac dev is deeply enjoyable as a designer.</p>
<p>A LOT of animations are trivial in SwiftUI, but not trivial at all in web. Examples are transitions: in SwiftUI, all you need is wrapping the state within withAnimation, which is absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>I love Tailwind and it's a huge upgrade from CSS. But sometimes, I have to write endless :dark, :hover, [values], etc.</p>
<p>Not saying that SwiftUI is better, but it's really enjoyable to just add modifiers as extra containers. Masking and border gradients, shaders are super trivial in SwiftUI.</p>
<p>For example, this is my Styles.swift file which I created for pretty much all the UIs for my Mac app. Modifiers take care of customizing the padding, rounded corners, font size, etc. Primary, secondary, tertiary colors are auto-light/dark.</p>
<p>Let me finish with Supabase versus Firebase. I've used the latter for years, although most prominently for DreamCut.</p>
<p><span className="text-blue-400">@supabase</span> feels more like mysql/phpmyadmin back my php days. You need to be far more familiar with sql queries. Yeah, you can click buttons, but learning query works REALLY well with AI. Just always ask the sql query.</p>
<p>Especially for RLS. Those who knows knows. RLS is my new bane. But otherwise, I love how easy it is to set up Supabase for the first time. Functions are super easy to deploy compared to Firebase. The Schema visualizer. But SQL all the things!👌</p>
<p>The site took 2 days to create. The Mac app + Supabase took 2 weeks and some days.</p>
<p>I suspect my next project is gonna be faster in a few months. But most importantly, I'll be able to create way more powerful things, skipping the menial things.</p>
<p>Figma might make a comeback with AI. I mean, Canva did. Plugins are keeping it alive and well for now.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you do enjoy this long thread, please drop a comment. I'll be happy to do more. Try out Aura and DreamCut, if just to see what AI can do for designers.</p>
